# Qbot Plugins
Welcome to the official repository for Qbot plugins. Please note that anything in this repository is not endorsed by Lengo Labs, and are simply hosting for community creations and plugins you can add to v7. They are also each individually licensed.

## Instructions
To find plugins, click the link above to view our directory. Once you select one, you should see instructions and licensing information in the README.md file.

## Contributing
Create a folder with a unique name for your plugin, and include a README.md file talking about what your plugin is about and how to install it. If approved, it will be displayed in the [Lengo Labs Discord server](https://lengolabs.com/discord). Please make sure your submission meets these requirements before submitting it:

* Message content and embeds should always go through the locale file.
* You should try to keep message styling consistent with how Qbot has it.
* There needs to be installation instructions in the README.md file.

Please note that the requirements above are not an exhaustive list as well, but you must meet those to get approved.
